            <h2>A little about me ðŸŒ•</h2>
            <p>Hi there! I am a 3<sup>rd</sup> year B.Tech undergrad pursuing Electronics and Communication Engineering. I love making websites, solving problems, and listening to music.<br /> <br />I enjoy calmness and usually like to be alone, because people are too noisy and annoying. Just kidding, I&apos;m very friendly and sociable. Or am I?</p>
